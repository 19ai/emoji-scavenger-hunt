# üëæ Emoji Scavenger Hunt üëæ

Emoji Scavenger Hunt is an experimental web based game that makes use of TensorFlow.js to identify objects seen by your webcam or mobile camera in the browser. We show you emojis üçå ‚è∞ ‚òïÔ∏è üì± and you have to find those objects in the real world before your timer runs out üèÜ üëç.

## Development

```sh
yarn prep
```

Running `yarn prep` will use yarn to get the right packages and setup the right folders. If you don't have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) you can install it via homebrew (for Mac). If you‚Äôre already running node/npm with nvm (our recommendation) you can install yarn without node using `brew install yarn --without-node`.

In order to start local development we also require the installation of the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads) and associated [App Engine Components](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/download). These are used for the local webserver and pushing to app engine for static site hosting.

Once you have both installed you can run the local development server with:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This task uses `watchify` to continually watch for changes to JS and SASS files and recompiles them if any changes are detected. You can access the local development server at `http://localhost:3000/`

When building assets for production use:

```sh
yarn build
```

This will minify SASS and JS for serving in production.
